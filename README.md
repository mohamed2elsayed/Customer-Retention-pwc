    <h1>Task-3: PWC Customer Retention</h1>
    <p>This repository contains the work for Task-3 of Forage's virtual internship for PWC Customer Retention. The PhoneNow Onsite Manager, Janet, requested a Power BI dashboard that reflects all relevant metrics in the dataset. The dashboard aims to answer the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Which customers left within the last month?</li>
        <li>What services has each customer signed up for? This includes phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.</li>
        <li>What is the customer account information? This includes the duration as a customer, contract type, payment method, paperless billing status, monthly charges, total charges, and the number of tickets opened in the administrative and technical categories.</li>
        <li>What is the demographic information about customers? This includes gender, age range, and whether they have partners and dependents.</li>
    </ul>
